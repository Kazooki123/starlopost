# What is IDS?

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a software application or device that monitors a network or system for malicious activity or policy violations. IDSs can be network-based or host-based, and they can detect attacks by:

* Analyzing network packets
* Identifying user accounts and processes involved in an attack
* Determining the intended outcome of an attempted attack
