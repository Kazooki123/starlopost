# What is IDS?

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a software application or device that **monitors** a network or system for malicious activity or policy **violations**. IDSs can be network-based or host-based, and they can detect attacks by:

* (1)Analyzing network packets
* (2)Identifying user accounts and processes involved in an attack
* (3)Determining the intended outcome of an attempted attack
